How to build
----------------
Music Player uses the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build system. If you don't already have Android Studio installed on your computer, follow these instructions.
1. Download the project's source files either through ZIP file or Github Desktop.
2. Download Android Studio, which includes the Android SDK and Gradle, from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/). Note: Android Studio and the SDK do take up a large amount of storage space, so make sure you have enough on your ```C:\ ``` drive. The installation might take a few minutes depending on your current computer specs or bandwidth speed.
3. Once Android Studio is downloaded, you should see a welcome screen for Android Studio. Click on *Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc...)*.
4. Navigate to the directory where the project's files are located, and select the project to build it. (It should have a Gradle icon next to the name.)

Otherwise, follow these instructions.
1. Download the project's source files either through ZIP file or Github Desktop.
2. Start Android Studio and make sure to close any open Android Studio projects.
3. From the Android Studio menu bar, select **File >> New >> Import Project**.
4. Navigate to the directory where the project's files are located, and select the project to build it. (It should have a Gradle icon next to the name.)
